        <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/housing" target="_">UC Berkeley’s Othering and Belonging Institute</a>
        is a group dedicated to advancing research that transforms

        <a href="https://evictionresearch.net/" target="_">The Eviction Research Network</a> is a UC Berkeley research
        group under the larger Urban Displacement Project that
        focuses
        on collecting, analyzing, and mapping the demographics of eviction. Described as “a collaborative research
        project
        for
        social good,” the ERN is to increase public awareness of the prevalence and drivers of eviction nationwide,
        particularly

        <a href="https://www.richmondland.org/">Richmond LAND</a> is a member-based organization whose mission is to
        build community power and maintain long-term
        affordability by holding land and properties in a community land trust. Through grassroots community organizing,
        land
        acquisition, and housing development, Richmond LAND removes land from the speculative real estate market to
        create
        pathways for affordable housing and lasting community benefit.
