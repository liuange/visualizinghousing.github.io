            And yet, current and historical practices of exclusionary policy,
            rising rents, and slow development have contributed to the
            affordable housing shortage, inequitable evictions, and broad
            displacement that make up the “housing crisis” today. Whether or not

            Located in Contra Costa County in the East San Francisco Bay Area,
            the city of Richmond is racially and economically diverse. Richmond
            feels like the average American city. A small, working-class
            suburban community, it went through a period of post-WWII
            industrialization and has a vibrant town known for grassroots
            engagement, including in the housing space.

        <h2>Living in Richmond is Not the Same for Everyone</h2>
        <p>
          Like many cities across the United States, life in Richmond is
          different depending on who you are and where you live. We see this
          most clearly by looking at the different impacts of the housing crisis
          on different groups of people, and most starkly in the housing
          outcomes between White and Black populations. Let’s look at some of
          these differences across zoning, renting vs. homeownership, and
          evictions.
        </p>
        <div class="blank_sm"></div>

        <!-- Zoning -->
        <h3 style="text-align: center">Where you live</h3>
        <p>
          Zoning laws shape how we live. From commercial shopping centers to
          farms to new housing, they govern what can be built, and where. These
          highly prescriptive rules dictate construction between single-family
          homes and dense multi-family apartment complexes. Research by the
          Othering and Belonging Institute shows that residing in single-family
          zones is highly correlated with better quality-of-life: in fact, they
          state, “...cities with high levels of single-family zoning have
          greater resources in virtually every statistic we are able to
          measure.”
        </p>
        <div class="blank_sm"></div>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
          <img src="staticFiles\images\disparity\Disparate Impacts Viz.svg" />
        </div>
        <div class="blank_sm"></div>
        <p>
          However, residence in single family zones break sharply on racial
          lines. White residents are more likely to live in single-family zones,
          while Black residents are more likely to reside in multifamily zones.

          Restrictive covenants, like the one above, explicitly restricted the
          sale or rent of properties to non-white residents. Although
          unenforceable today, the text can still be found in some leases.

        <!-- Renting vs. Owning: Building Generational Wealth -->
        <div class="blank"></div>
        <h3>Who owns homes in Richmond?</h3>
        <p>
          Homeownership is one of the primary methods for building generational
          wealth and accessing the improved quality-of-life that comes with it.
          Owning a home can provide greater stability than renting by allowing
          residents to stay in their community, build long-term equity, and to
          invest in their community’s education and other public services
          through their home’s property taxes.  Like many other cities in
          California, Richmond’s homeownership has often been restricted to
          wealthy white neighborhoods and maintained through policies such as
          Proposition 13, which defines state increase in property tax.

          In Richmond, white residents own homes at more than
          <span class="emphasis_red">2x</span> the rate of Black residents and
          <span class="emphasis_red">1.3x</span> that of Hispanic residents.
          Meanwhile, Hispanic residents rent almost 2x more and Black residents
          rent around 1.5x more than White residents.

        <!-- Evictions -->
        <h3>Who faces eviction?</h3>
        <p>
          Who is evicted is related to one’s socioeconomic and geographic
          reality. Eviction is one of the most common methods of displacement,
          which is when a resident is forced to move against their will.
          Displacement can have negative effects ranging from worse physical and
          mental health, more emergency room visits, lower educational outcomes
          for children, food insecurity, to higher rates of future homelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using data from when tenants are officially removed from their home by
          the county sheriff from January 2017 to March 2022, the Eviction
          Research Network finds that there are significant racial disparities
          in evictions in Richmond. Note that this dataset is a severe
          undercount of the actual number of evictions occurring, but still
          represents the overall trend.

              These neighborhoods are predominantly Black and Hispanic. The

          While eviction moratoria during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced overall

          higher rates compared to White and Asian residents. In 2017, there
          were 3.5 Black and 2.5 Hispanic evictions for every 1 White eviction.
          In 2021, there were 3.5 Black evictions and 4 Hispanic eviction for

          Redlining excluded racial minorities, especially Black residents, by
          limiting their ability to obtain loans and own their homes. While not
          explicitly racist, the outcomes often were. Banks and federal loan
          providers graded predominantly Black neighborhoods as
          <span style="color: var(--red)">“red”</span>, limiting financial
          investment. White neighborhoods received
          <span style="color: var(--green)">“green”</span> grades and favorable
          access to credit, leading to segregation. This process was common
          throughout the United States, including the Bay Area, pictured in the
          map below.

    <div class="center_section" style="height: fit-content">
      <div class="content_center">
        <h2 id="issues_today">Issues in Housing Continue Today</h2>
        <p>
          The systemic injustices of the past have created disparities not
          easily unraveled. An equitable future requires coordinated effort and
          investment. In reality, there are many actors in this space whose
          interests are often directly at odds. Whether intentionally or not,
          interactions between local government, the general public, and housing
          developers are why affordable housing continues to be an issue.
        </p>
        <div class="blank_sm"></div>
        <h3>Local Government</h3>
        <p>
          Local governments have a mandate to plan for and meet housing needs.
          How plans are implemented is dependent on the priorities, resources,
          capacity of the city's government, and other actors like developers
          and voters. A lack of funding for affordable housing is both a
          national and local complaint. Richmond's county (Contra Costa), for
          example, has been criticized in particular for not following through
          on project expectations by disproportionately falling short of
          developing housing for lower-income households.
        </p>

        <img
          src="staticFiles\images\issues_today\local_gov.svg"
          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
          <p
            style="
              width: 80%;
              line-height: 1.1;
              font-size: 14px;
              color: var(--gray-dark);
            "
          >
            The trend that Contra Costa County exhibits here of
            disproportionally under-developing housing planned for very low and
            low income households mirrors the rest of the Bay Area. The
            Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), sets goals for housing
            developments based on population growth and housing needs. Between
            2007 and 2014, the Great Recession affected the ability to finance
            affordable housing, and was further impacted by an overall decrease
            in funding from state and federal sources.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="blank_sm"></div>
        <h3>Community</h3>
        <p>
          The community plays an important role in how local governments
          implement plans. Housing bonds fund loans for developers to create
          affordable housing— all this must be approved by voters. Community
          engagement on local and neighborhood plans affect the housing goals of
          the city and county overall. For example, opposition against
          multifamily development by current residents, commonly referred to as
          “Not in My Backyard” (NIMBY) opposition, impacts the development
          timeline of projects by an average of 7.4 months and adds an average
          5.6% increase in total development costs. Community engagement can
          also inspire funding to go to projects that support communities
          aspirations, such as creating affordable housing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important for the community to participate in local elections and
          engage with housing discussions. After all, votes can shape
          communities.
        </p>

        <div class="blank_sm"></div>
        <h3>Housing Developers</h3>
        <p>
          Multifamily developments must adhere to a variety of regulations in
          order to protect the health and safety of residents, and ensure the
          integrity of the building and surrounding area. Adhering to
          regulations is extremely important to protect the public.
          Unfortunately, red tape can also delay development and comes at a
          tangible expense to the project. This creates a lack of incentive and
          opportunity for developers to build affordable, multifamily housing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conflicting standards across regulations and overly time consuming
          review processes are inflating the cost of development, limiting who
          can afford to contribute to multifamily housing. At present,
          regulation compliance constitutes an average of 40% of a project's
          total development cost— a high percentage considering the additional
          cost of land, labor, and materials.
        </p>
        <div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center">
          <img
            style="max-width: 45vw"
            src="staticFiles\images\issues_today\dev_cost.svg"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Multifamily development is increasingly being conducted by large
          corporations who have easy access to funding, rather than smaller,
          local developers who may want to invest in the community. There needs
          to be a balance between regulations that protect the public and
          encourage affordable housing development.
