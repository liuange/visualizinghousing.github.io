          Located in Contra Costa County in the East San Francisco Bay Area,
          the city of Richmond is racially and economically diverse. Richmond
          feels like the average American city. A small, working-class
          suburban community, it went through a period of post-WWII
          industrialization and has a vibrant town known for grassroots
          engagement, including in the housing space.

      <h2>Living in Richmond is Not the Same for Everyone</h2>
      <p>
        Like many cities across the United States, life in Richmond is
        different depending on who you are and where you live. We see this
        most clearly by looking at the different impacts of the housing crisis
        on different groups of people, and most starkly in the housing
        outcomes between White and Black populations. Let’s look at some of
        these differences across zoning, renting vs. homeownership, and
        evictions.
      </p>
      <div class="blank_sm"></div>

      <!-- Zoning -->
      <h3 style="text-align: center">Where you live</h3>
      <p>
        Zoning laws shape how we live. From commercial shopping centers to
        farms to new housing, they govern what can be built, and where. These
        highly prescriptive rules dictate construction between single-family
        homes and dense multi-family apartment complexes. Research by the
        Othering and Belonging Institute shows that residing in single-family
        zones is highly correlated with better quality-of-life: in fact, they
        state, “...cities with high levels of single-family zoning have
        greater resources in virtually every statistic we are able to
        measure.”
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
        <img src="staticFiles\images\disparity\Disparate Impacts Viz.svg" />
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, residence in single family zones break sharply on racial
        lines. White residents are more likely to live in single-family zones,
        while Black residents are more likely to reside in multifamily zones.

          Restrictive covenants, like the one above, explicitly restricted the
          sale or rent of properties to non-white residents. Although
          unenforceable today, the text can still be found in some leases.

      <!-- Renting vs. Owning: Building Generational Wealth -->
      <div class="blank_sm"></div>
      <h3>Who owns homes in Richmond?</h3>
      <p>
        Homeownership is one of the primary methods for building generational
        wealth and accessing the improved quality-of-life that comes with it.
        Owning a home can provide greater stability than renting by allowing
        residents to stay in their community, build long-term equity, and to
        invest in their community’s education and other public services
        through their home’s property taxes.  Like many other cities in
        California, Richmond’s homeownership has often been restricted to
        wealthy white neighborhoods and maintained through policies such as
        Proposition 13, which defines state increase in property tax.

      <p>
        In Richmond, white residents own homes at more than 2x Black residents
        and 1.3x Hispanic residents. For renting, Hispanic residents rent
        almost 2x more and Black residents rent around 1.5x more than White
        residents.

      <div class="blank_sm"></div>

      <!-- Evictions -->
      <h3>Who faces eviction?</h3>
      <p>
        Who is evicted is related to one’s socioeconomic and geographic
        reality. Eviction is one of the most common methods of displacement,
        which is when a resident is forced to move against their will.
        Displacement can have negative effects ranging from worse physical and
        mental health, more emergency room visits, lower educational outcomes
        for children, food insecurity, to higher rates of future homelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using data from when tenants are officially removed from their home by
        the county sheriff from January 2017 to March 2022, the Eviction
        Research Network finds that there are significant racial disparities
        in evictions in Richmond. Note that this dataset is a severe
        undercount of the actual number of evictions occurring, but still
        represents the overall trend.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div class="section_narrow" style="padding: 0; column-gap: 2vw">

          <p style="width: 100%; text-align: left">
            This map shows neighborhoods with the highest levels of recorded
            evictions:
            <span style="color: var(--blue); font-weight: bold">the Iron Triangle</span>,
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Panhandle, and Hilltop.</span>
            These neighborhoods are predominantly Black and Hispanic. The
            current housing landscape places the vulnerable - who are often
            racial minorities - in precarious situations rather than support
            them.

        While eviction moratoria during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced overall
        evictions in 2020, Black and Hispanic residents are still evicted at
        higher rates compared to White and Asian residents. In 2017, there
        were 3.5 Black and 2.5 Hispanic evictions for every 1 White eviction.
        In 2021, there were 3.5 Black evictions and 4 Hispanic eviction for
        every White eviction.

        Redlining excluded racial minorities, especially Black residents, by
        limiting their ability to obtain loans and own their homes. While not
        explicitly racist, the outcomes often were. Banks and federal loan
        providers graded predominantly Black neighborhoods as
        <span style="color: var(--red)">“red”</span>, limiting financial
        investment. White neighborhoods received
        <span style="color: var(--green)">“green”</span> grades and favorable
        access to credit, leading to segregation. This process was common
        throughout the United States, including the Bay Area, pictured in the
        map below.

      <p>
        There is a long history of segregation and racist policies that are
        rooted in the history of Richmond. Starting with World War II, we can
        see the intersecting influences of wartime economies, corporate
        interests, migration, and racial bias in the city.

  <!-- Issues in Housing Continue Today -->
  <div class="center_section" style="height: fit-content">
    <div class="content_center">
      <h2 id="issues_today">Issues in Housing Continue Today</h2>
      <p>
        The systemic injustices of the past have created disparities not
        easily unraveled. An equitable future requires coordinated effort and
        investment. In reality, there are many actors in this space whose
        interests are often directly at odds. Whether intentionally or not,
        interactions between local government, the general public, and housing
        developers are why affordable housing continues to be an issue.
      </p>
      <h3>Local Government</h3>
      <p>
        Local governments have a mandate to plan for and meet housing needs.
        How plans are implemented is dependent on the priorities, resources,
        capacity of the city's government, and other actors like developers
        and voters. A lack of funding for affordable housing is both a
        national and local complaint. Richmond's county, Contra Costa, for
        example, has been criticized in particular for not following through
        on project expectations by disproportionately falling short of
        developing housing for lower-income households.
      </p>

      <img src="staticFiles\images\issues_today\local_gov.svg" style="width: 100%" />
      <p>
        The trend that Contra Costa county (where Richmond is) exhibits here
        of disproportionally under-developing housing planned for very low and
        low income households mirrors the rest of the Bay Area. The
        Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), sets goals for housing
        developments based on population growth and housing needs. Between
        2007 and 2014, the Great Recession affected the ability to finance
        affordable housing, and was further impacted by an overall decrease in
        funding from state and federal sources.
      </p>

      <h3>Community</h3>
      <p>
        The community plays an important role in how local governments
        implement plans. Housing bonds fund loans for developers to create
        affordable housing— all this must be approved by voters. Community
        engagement on local and neighborhood plans affect the housing goals of
        the city and county overall. For example, opposition against
        multifamily development by current residents, commonly referred to as
        “Not in My Backyard” (NIMBY) opposition, impacts the development
        timeline of projects by an average of 7.4 months and adds an average
        5.6% increase in total development costs. Community engagement can
        also inspire funding to go to projects that support communities
        aspirations, such as creating affordable housing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important for the community to participate in local elections and
        engage with housing discussions. After all, votes can shape
        communities.
      </p>

      <h3>Housing Developers</h3>
      <p>
        Multifamily developments must adhere to a variety of regulations in
        order to protect the health and safety of residents, and ensure the
        integrity of the building and surrounding area. Adhering to
        regulations is extremely important to protect the public.
        Unfortunately, red tape can also delay development and comes at a
        tangible expense to the project. This creates a lack of incentive and
        opportunity for developers to build affordable, multifamily housing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conflicting standards across regulations and overly time consuming
        review processes are inflating the cost of development, limiting who
        can afford to contribute to multifamily housing. At present,
        regulation compliance constitutes an average of 40% of a project's
        total development cost— a high percentage considering the additional
        cost of land, labor, and materials.
      </p>
      <img style="max-width: 45vw; position: relative; left: 10%" src="staticFiles\images\issues_today\dev_cost.svg" />
      <p>
        Multifamily development is increasingly being conducted by large
        corporations who have easy access to funding, rather than smaller,
        local developers who may want to invest in the community. There needs
        to be a balance between regulations that protect the public and
        encourage affordable housing development.
